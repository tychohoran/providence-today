Reader bios:

Noor Ibn Najam is a poet and physicist whose work teases, challenges, breaks, and creates lingual rules and structures. She's received fellowships from Callaloo, the Vermont Studio Center, and the Watering Hole, and her poems have been published with the Academy of American Poets, the Rumpus, and others. Noor's chapbook, Praise to Lesser Gods of Love, was published by Glass poetry press in 2019 and grapples with the ever-shifting role of love in the human experience—and how best to worship such a fickle deity.

James Gendron is the author of Sexual Boat (Sex Boats) and Weirde Sister.
